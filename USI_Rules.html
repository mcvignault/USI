									<h2>RULES</h2>
									<span class="byline">How to participate and succeed in the Ultimate Sports Investor Competition</span>
								</header>
								<p><a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/pics02.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
								<h2>REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS</h2>
								<p>Each player must have a personal account at DraftKings.</br>
If you do not have an account, please utilize our referral link when registering by clicking <a href="#">here</a>.</br> 

In order to create an account, DraftKings requires the following:
<li>your full name</li>
<li>a valid e-mail address</li>
<li>province and country of residence</li>
<li>date of birth (to confirm you are of legal age)</li>
</br>
For the purposes of this competition, you do not need to deposit any money into the account; however, if you choose to deposit $5 or more, you will receive a 25% deposit bonus (i.e. $100 deposit will receive $25 to be used on the DraftKings' site).*</br>
</br>
*This bonus is only available to new users who use the referral link above; if you already have an account, please do not try to create a second one, as this is strictly forbidden by DraftKings' TOS and will result in a permanent ban from the site.</p>
<h2>DAILY FANTASY SPORTS RULES</h2>
<p>For a summary of DraftKings scoring and rules, please click <a href="https://www.draftkings.com/help/rules/mlb">here</a>.</p>
<p>
On the days of competitions, users will be sent an invitation to the evening's contest no later than 3 p.m.</br>

After receiving the invite, each competitor must accept the invite, and submit a lineup (through the DraftKings website or mobile app) by 7 p.m.</br>

It is strongly recommended that users download the free DraftKings mobile app (available for iOS and Android), which will provide notifications when an invitation has been received, and allow users to follow their contests throughout the evening.
</p>
<p>
At the end of each daily fantasy contest, participants will be ranked in descending order, and points will be awarded as follows:
<li>1st Place: 5 points</li>
<li>2nd Place: 4 points</li>
<li>3rd Place: 3 points</li>
<li>4th Place: 2 points</li>
<li>5th Place: 1 point</li>
</p>
<h2>SPORTS BETTING RULES</h2>

<p>i.) Sports bets may only be placed in the designated sport of the night. For single-sport competitions, such as MLB, this means bets can only be made on MLB games. For multi-sport
competitions, such as NHL and NBA, one sport will be chosen on each competition night, and bets can only be placed in that sport. The chosen sport will align with the sport in which
 the DFS tournament is competing.</p>
<p>
ii.) Betting options for each of the sports are as follows:
</p>
<p><h1>NBA</h1>
<li>Totals (total points scored in the game) - Over/Under</li>
<li>Spreads (expected point difference at completion of game, set by Sportsbook) - Home/Away</li>
<li>Moneyline (win or loss) - Home/Away</li></p>
 <p><h1>NHL</h1>
​<li>Moneyline (win or loss) - Home/Away</li>
<li>Totals (total goals scored in the game) - Over/Under</li>
<li>Puckline (win by 2 or more goals) - Home/Away</li>
</p>
<p>iii.) The betting lines (odds/prices) will be sent via e-mail by noon on the days of contests.
​
It is each participants' responsibility to inform Sports [Tr]en[d]gineering (trendengsports@gmail.com) of their bets by 7 p.m. that night.

No bets will be accepted once the evening's games have begun.
</p>
<p>iv.) In order to encourage smart bankroll management, as well as to prolong the competition, participants will be limited to betting a maximum of 25% of their bankroll each night.

For example, each competitor will have a $20 bankroll on the first night. That means that the most a user can bet on the first night is $5 (i.e., $20 x 25%).
If the competitor's bankroll increases to $30 by night two, they will then be able to place a maximum bet of $7.50 (i.e., $30 x 25%).
</p>
<p>v.) In order to promote smarter decision-making and minimize the luck factor, parlays (i.e., combining multiple games into one bet to increase the payout) will be limited to two games.

In the case of a two-game parlay, two bets will be combined into one, and both bets must be successful in order to win.
</p>
<p>vi.) Points will be awarded in the same fashion as they are in the daily fantasy sports contests.

Once all games are complete for the evening, participants will be ranked based on their earnings that night. Points will again be awarded as follows
<ul>1st Place: 5 points</ul>
<ul>2nd Place: 4 points</ul>
<ul>3rd Place: 3 points</ul>
<ul>4th Place: 2 points</ul>
<ul>5th Place: 1 point</ul>
</p>
<p>
vii.) In addition to the overall prize pool, participants will be given the opportunity to receive prizes equal to that of any betting profits made throughout the competition. For example, if a competitor ends the competition with a bankroll of $50, they will receive a prize of $30 
​(i.e., Total bankroll - initial stake = profit prize).
</p>
<h2>DFS ELIMINATION</h2>
i) Each competition night a separate DFS contest will be held in which the last place finisher will be eliminated.
</br></br>
ii) The elimination pool will run simultaneously with the main Ultimate Sports Investor competition, however you are not required to enter the same lineup in each contest.  Draft Kings allows you to draft as many lineups as you want in a night, therefore if you choose, you have the opportunity to draft different lineups to enter into the main contest and the elimination pool.  Of course, you may enter the same lineup into both as well.
</br></br>
iii) Registration into the elimination pool is not limited, however the total number of participants will be split into individual pools with a maximum of 11 participants such that one winner will remain at the end of 10 nights.  If pools of 11 people are not achieved (i.e. 9 people), Sports [TR]en[D]gineering will designate certain nights of the competition as elimination pool nights (i.e. if 9 people are in the pool, 8 of the 10 nights will be elimination pool nights).
</br></br>
iv) The pool will be a winner-take-all prize pool.
