<h2>DAILY FANTASY SPORTS RULES</h2>
<p>For a summary of DraftKings scoring and rules, please click <a href="https://www.draftkings.com/help/rules/mlb">here</a>.</p>
<p>
DraftKings contests will be available via the links on the "Competition" page the night before the day of the competition.<br />

Each competitor must submit a lineup (through the DraftKings website or mobile app) by 7 p.m.<br />

It is strongly recommended that users download the free DraftKings mobile app (available for iOS and Android), which will provide notifications when an invitation has been received, and allow users to follow their contests throughout the evening.
</p>
<p>
At the end of each daily fantasy contest, participants will be ranked in descending order, and points will be awarded as follows:
<li>1st Place: 5 points</li>
<li>2nd Place: 4 points</li>
<li>3rd Place: 3 points</li>
<li>4th Place: 2 points</li>
<li>5th Place: 1 point</li>
</p>
<h2>SPORTS BETTING RULES</h2>

<p>i.) Sports bets may only be placed in the designated sport of the night. For single-sport competitions, such as MLB, this means bets can only be made on MLB games. For multi-sport
competitions, such as NHL and NBA, one sport will be chosen on each competition night, and bets can only be placed in that sport. The chosen sport will align with the sport in which
 the DFS tournament is competing.</p>
<p>
ii.) Betting options are as follows:
<li>Moneyline (win or loss) - H/A</li>
<li>Spread/Runline/Puckline (expected point difference at completion of game) - H+/A+</li>
<li>Totals (total points scored by both teams - O/U</li>
</p>

<p>iii.) The betting lines will be available in the "Competition" tab by noon on the days of contests.
​
It is each participants' responsibility to submit their selections by 7 p.m. on the night of the competition.

No bets will be accepted once the evening's games have begun.
</p>
<p>iv.) In order to encourage smart bankroll management, as well as to prolong the competition, participants will be limited to betting a maximum of 25% of their bankroll each night.

For example, each competitor will have a $20 bankroll on the first night. That means that the most a user can bet on the first night is $5 (i.e., $20 x 25%).
If the competitor's bankroll increases to $30 by night two, they will then be able to place a maximum bet of $7.50 (i.e., $30 x 25%).
</p>

<p>v.) Points will be awarded in the same fashion as they are in the daily fantasy sports contests.

Once all games are complete for the evening, participants will be ranked based on their earnings that night. Points will again be awarded as follows
<ul>1st Place: 5 points</ul>
<ul>2nd Place: 4 points</ul>
<ul>3rd Place: 3 points</ul>
<ul>4th Place: 2 points</ul>
<ul>5th Place: 1 point</ul>
</p>
<p>
vi.) In addition to the overall prize pool, participants will be given the opportunity to receive prizes equal to that of any betting profits made throughout the competition. For example, if a competitor ends the competition with a bankroll of $50, they will receive a prize of $30 
​(i.e., Total bankroll - initial stake = profit prize).
</p>
<h2>DFS ELIMINATION</h2>
i) Each competition night a separate DFS contest will be held in which the last place finisher will be eliminated.
</br></br>
ii) The elimination pool will run simultaneously with the main Ultimate Sports Investor competition, however you are not required to enter the same lineup in each contest.  Draft Kings allows you to draft as many lineups as you want in a night, therefore if you choose, you have the opportunity to draft different lineups to enter into the main contest and the elimination pool.  Of course, you may enter the same lineup into both as well.
</br></br>
iii) Registration into the elimination pool is not limited, however the total number of participants will be split into individual pools with a maximum of 11 participants such that one winner will remain at the end of 10 nights.  If pools of 11 people are not achieved (i.e. 9 people), Sports [TR]en[D]gineering will designate certain nights of the competition as elimination pool nights (i.e. if 9 people are in the pool, 8 of the 10 nights will be elimination pool nights).
</br></br>
iv) The pool will be a winner-take-all prize pool.
