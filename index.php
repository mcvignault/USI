					<p>The Ultimate Sports Investor is a competition that combines sports betting and daily fantasy sports in order to test your true sports acumen.</p>
					<p>In it's simplest form the participation in the Ultimate Sports Investor Competition involves the following:
						<li>Make sports bets and draft Daily Fantasy Sports rosters <a href="MLB_Games2.php">HERE</a></li>
						<li>Watch your teams win and players put up points</li>
						<li>Earn more return on your bets and score more fantasy points than the competition</li>
						<li>Win money</li></p>
						<p>Simple as a Bryce Harper broken bat homerun!</p>
						<p>The competition will run for 5 weeks, with competition nights twice per week (10 nights total). Full rules can be found on the <a href="USI_Rules.php">Rules</a> page. </p>
